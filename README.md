# Clapp

Clapp stands for CoverLetter App. A small web app to allow anyone to auto-generate a list of personalized cover letters by using their Indeed.com job search.

Goal: Cover letters are a drag but now you can send every potential employer a generated, yet personal cover letter by addressing the Company directly, the job title, and matching their requests with your talents. It's a straightforward yet effective cover letter that employers appreciate and only takes you a few seconds. 

Reduces the time of personalizing every job application so you can focus on job hunting rather than getting hung up on a personalized letter.
